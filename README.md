# Srinivas_Ramanujan_Magic_Square
Ramanujan Magic Square is a matrix of numbers in which every row, column and diagonal adds up to the same number. A square with many distinct integers placed in such a way that the sum or total of the numbers is the same in every row, column, and main diagonal, as well as typically on some or all of the other diagonals, is known as a magic square. 
Srinivasa Ramanujan had a special affinity toward numbers. A Mathematician without parallel, he made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. His works have been collected and analyzed throughout the world.

# What is Ramanujan Magic Square?
In recreational mathematics, a magic square of order n is an arrangement of n2 numbers, usually distinct integers, in a square, such that the n numbers in all rows, all columns, and both diagonals sum to the same constant. A normal magic square contains the integers from 1 to n2. The term “magic square” is also sometimes used to refer to any of the various types of word square.

Magic squares may be classified into three types:

(i) Additive magic square (standard magic square): Its elements are arranged in such a way that they add to give a magic sum (S) along rows, columns, and diagonals.

(ii) Multiplicative magic square: Its elements are arranged to multiply, giving a magic product (P) along rows, columns, and diagonals.

(iii) Additive-multiplicative magic square: Its elements are arranged to add and multiply to give S and P, respectively, along rows, columns, and diagonals.

Mathematician, Ramanujan created a Magic Square: one of its kind fascinating mathematical object that has a deep and mysterious history that has been so far unmanageable for researchers and mathematicians to decipher. Knowing and learning about this magic square can be helpful and rewarding for students.
Ramanujan magic square is a special kind of magic square that was invented by the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. 

# What is Unique about Ramanujan Magic Square?
It is possible to create a Ramanujan magic square by starting with any 3×3 magic square and adding or deleting the same number from each cell. This implies that there are an endless number of Ramanujan magic squares that could exist! It is said that he discovered this method while working on his famous notebook.

There are many things that make this method of creating magic squares unique.

(i) Unlike most other methods, it takes a unique approach. Ramanujan’s strategy makes use of geometry rather than algebra or mathematics. This improves its visual attractiveness and makes it simpler to comprehend. Additionally, compared to other techniques, it has the advantage of producing larger magic squares.
(ii) The way the Ramanujan magic square is put together is another distinctive feature. The majority of other ways to make magic squares employ a predetermined configuration. This indicates that the numbers in the square are set up in a particular order. On the other hand, Ramanujan’s approach makes use of a flexible structure. As a result, the square can be built with greater originality and variety.
(iii) Last but not least, Ramanujan magic square is special because it can be utilized to make various magic squares. Most other techniques can only produce one kind of magic square. Ramanujan’s technique is significantly more robust and adaptable thanks to this flexibility.

# How Ramanujan Magic Square was Constructed? 
Here’s how one possibility of Ramanujan’s square can be constructed.

The important dates in the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan were compiled from various sources. These dates were taken two digits at a time, representing either the date of the month or the month or the first/second half of the four-digit year. As an example, Ramanujan’s date-of-birth 22-12-1887 is taken as four separate entries as 22 12 18 and 87. In short, Ramanujan’s entire life history is reproduced here, from his birth to till date in Ramanujan style. In India, the day December 22’ has been declared as National Mathematics Day.

Since the sum of the birth date is 139, we need to make sure that all the other rows and columns are 139. Also, the sum of all the main diagonals is 139.
